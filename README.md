We are cinephiles. We are deeply exploring the cinema culture for many years and we realized that only making excellent cinemas is not enough to make a cinema successful. As Sir Satyajit Ray said producers also needs to take care of getting reach of as many people possible. Cinema Screens and Halls are playing the role for many decades. Later Television become a better bridge between creators and consumers of visual contents. But now times is far a head of those mediums. Internet connected peoples far beyond of unimaginable possibilities. By through this we can distribute much faster content globally. With this idea we are presenting to you the PepStudio, an over the top online platform. While we are talking about reaching to masses in india, we had to make an app that is compatible to all kind of devices. So we made it very lite and very less resource consuming. The whole app is only 17 megabytes. It puts very less pressure to the hardware.
